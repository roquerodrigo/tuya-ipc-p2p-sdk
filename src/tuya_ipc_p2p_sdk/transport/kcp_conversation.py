"""
One KCP conversation on a shared relay connection.

The relay runs over TCP, so segments arrive in order and are never lost in
transit. What still matters on the wire is the bookkeeping the peer expects:
every push has to be acknowledged or the device stops sending, ``una`` has to
advance so the device can retire its send queue, and fragmented messages have
to be rejoined.
